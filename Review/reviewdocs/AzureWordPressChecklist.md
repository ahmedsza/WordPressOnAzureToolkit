# Azure WordPress on App Service — Definitive Well-Architected Checklist

This is the single, definitive review checklist for a WordPress workload hosted on Azure App Service. It merges and supersedes three prior checklists in this folder:

- [wordpresschecklist.md](wordpresschecklist.md) — pillar-organized, ID-tagged consolidation (used here as the structural backbone).
- [checklist.md](checklist.md) — resource-type-organized checklist; its per-resource depth for networking, NAT Gateway, Application Insights/Log Analytics, Communication Services, and Defender for Cloud is folded in as [Section 7](#7-resource-specific-supplementary-checklist).
- [WAF-WordPress-AppService-Checklist.md](WAF-WordPress-AppService-Checklist.md) — numbered WordPress/App Service checklist; its unique items (ARR affinity, auto-heal, wp-cron, DDoS Protection Standard, etc.) are folded into the relevant sections below, and its scoring rollup is reused in [Section 9](#9-scoring-summary).

It applies to the workload and its supporting services: App Service plans, web apps and slots, Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server, Azure Front Door and WAF, Blob Storage, Key Vault, Azure Managed Redis or Azure Cache for Redis, virtual networking (VNet/NSG/private endpoints/private DNS/NAT Gateway), Azure Monitor (Application Insights/Log Analytics), Microsoft Defender for Cloud, and optional Azure Communication Services.

Treat [checklist.md](checklist.md), [WAF-WordPress-AppService-Checklist.md](WAF-WordPress-AppService-Checklist.md), and [wordpresschecklist.md](wordpresschecklist.md) (including the archived copy in `reviewdocs/`) as superseded by this document once it is adopted.

## How to use this checklist

1. Record `Pass`, `Fail`, `N/A`, or `Not verified` for every applicable control. Do not use `N/A` without a documented rationale and approver.
2. A failed collection, unavailable API, or missing evidence means `Not verified`; it does not prove a control is absent.
3. Attach collector output (from `PSScripts/Invoke-CollectWordPressPosture.ps1`), Azure Policy, Defender for Cloud, Azure Advisor, Azure Monitor, deployment code, tests, or operational records as evidence.
4. Create a remediation item for each `Fail`, with owner, severity, target date, compensating control, and acceptance criteria.
5. Validate the controls against the workload's business impact, SLOs, RTO/RPO, data classification, compliance obligations, and regional feature availability.
6. Reassess after material changes and on an agreed operational cadence.

### Status and evidence key

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Pass` | Evidence proves the control is implemented and operated as intended. |
| `Fail` | Evidence proves the control is not met or is ineffective. |
| `N/A` | The control does not apply; the rationale and approver are recorded. |
| `Not verified` | Evidence is unavailable, incomplete, or requires a manual test. |

## 1. Workload foundations and governance

| ID | Review control | Avoid | Evidence | Status |

| SEC-12 | Use private connectivity and correct private DNS for MySQL, Blob Storage, Key Vault, Redis, and other supporting PaaS services when the risk model requires it; disable public paths after validation. | Private endpoint configured while public access remains unintentionally usable. | Private endpoints, DNS zones, service network settings, connectivity tests. | [ ] |

| SEC-19 | Apply restrictive CORS, CSP, HSTS, `X-Frame-Options`, and `X-Content-Type-Options` appropriate to the application; validate behavior rather than adding headers blindly. | Overly permissive origins or headers that break legitimate flows and are disabled later. | HTTP-header scan and regression tests. | [ ] |
| SEC-20 | Use least-privilege WordPress roles, individual administrators, strong authentication/MFA where possible, and audited administrator access. | Shared administrator accounts or default administrator names. | WordPress user/role review, identity controls. | [ ] |
| SEC-21 | Enable Defender for Cloud plans justified by deployed services; route Defender security alerts into an owned SIEM or response process and test triage. | Paying for plans without coverage validation or alert ownership. | Defender pricing, coverage, alerts, workflow automation. | [ ] |
| SEC-22 | Enable security-relevant control-plane and data-plane diagnostics, prevent telemetry from collecting secrets or unnecessary PII, and protect the log destination. | No audit trail or sensitive request bodies, tokens, and credentials in logs. | Diagnostic settings, workspace RBAC, redaction tests. | [ ] |
